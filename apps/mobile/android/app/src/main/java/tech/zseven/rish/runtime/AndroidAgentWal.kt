/**
 * The agent WAL, in the same bytes iOS writes: one file per storage root named
 * `agent-native-wal-v1.json`, holding the whole state as canonical JSON, and
 * replaced by write-temp, fsync, rename, fsync-directory.
 *
 * The format is shared on purpose. Every rule about what a stored state may
 * look like already lives in the core, and a WAL pulled off a device replays
 * through the same golden harness whichever platform wrote it. SQLite would
 * have meant a second storage adapter and a second answer to "what is
 * committed".
 *
 * The core also holds the committed state between transactions behind an
 * opaque handle, so a transaction does not re-read the file to learn what is
 * committed — and the handle is trusted only while the file it was read from
 * is still the file on disk.
